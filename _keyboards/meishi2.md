This one was picked up while I visited Tokyo and [Yusha Kobo](https://yushakobo.jp/) in 2019. At that time I wasn't sure
I would be this invested in the hobby, and thought it would be a fun little project. The day after I bought the
Meishi2 I ended up going back and buy myself an Ergodash Mini.

The board hasn't seen much use by me, as I don't really see the need for a macropad. However, I do like the look of them,
so there will be more macropads on this site.

For now it lets me easily take a screenshot and turn on/off [HazeOver](https://hazeover.com/). The other two buttons are
just there for show.

## Get your own

I'm not sure where you could buy the Meishi2 (except from [Yusha Kobo](https://yushakobo.jp/)), but the keyboard is open
source, meaning everything you need to order your own PCB is on
[github/Biacco42](https://github.com/Biacco42/meishi2). There is no build guide, but it's a really easy keyboard to
build, and you only need four switches, four diodes, a button switch, and a pro micro. The silk print on the PCB tells
you where each components goes.
