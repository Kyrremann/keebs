Bought around the same time I got my [RoMac]({{ site.baseurl }}/romac), and ended up as another macropad that I don't
really use. I do like the look of it with the black and white low-profile keycaps, like a small chess board.

It supports low profile switches, and I found this cool sandwhich case made by
[github/Khord](https://github.com/Khord/keyboard_cases/tree/master/chocopad), when searching for information about the
macropad. It gives it that extra premium look if you ask me.

Kinda regret putting the small plastic bumpers on the back when I look at the photo above.

## Get your own

This is designed and owned by
[Keeb.io](https://keeb.io/products/chocopad-16-key-macropad-for-kailh-choc-low-profile-switches), so you can just order
from them. They also have a [build guide](https://docs.keeb.io/chocopad-build-guide/), it's not the best, as they use
pictures from other keyboards to show you what to do in the more generic steps. I think this will make it a bit harder
to follow for novices.
