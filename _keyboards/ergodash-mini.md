My first real custom keyboard, bought at [Yusha Kobo](https://yushakobo.jp/), November 2019. It was pretty hard to pick
it out, I think I used around an hour before I settled for the Ergodash Mini. Originally I wanted 
[Plaid by hsgw](https://github.com/hsgw/plaid) but they where all sold out. I also looked at the Lily58, Corne, and
original Ergodash, but I liked the thumb cluster of the Ergodash, and felt that the number row was not necessary for me.

It hasn't been easy to start using a split 40% board, but the more I use it, the more I enjoy it, and the more I want to
try other split board. Especially the thumb cluster is something I want to experiment more with.

Surviving without the F- and number-row has been pretty easy to get adjusted too. Everything is just on a different
layer, but since it's so small, I don't have to move my hand that much, which leads to less stress for my hand. I'll
hopefully share all my keymaps later, either through [QMK-firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware) or via my own
Github repo.

Another challenge by switching to split-boards, are the ortholinear columns, that was a big change. And I'm still not
sure which type of columns are best for me.

## Get your own

Not that easy to get your hands on, but there may be some Japanese site still selling it. Luckily it's an open-source
keyboard, meaning that you can find what you need to order a PCB from
[github/omkbd](https://github.com/omkbd/ErgoDash/tree/master/mini). This is a more complex build, but most of the
components are though hole (except the RGB-LEDs). There is sadly no English build guide for the mini, but you can follow
the [regular one](https://github.com/omkbd/ErgoDash/blob/master/Doc/build-en.md), they are identical except for the top
row.
