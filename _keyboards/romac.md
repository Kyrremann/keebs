Another macropad, bought mostly for the aesthetics of the through-hole components. Personally not much to say about this
one, but you can safely said it's inspired by [Plaid](https://github.com/hsgw/plaid). And researching a little bit for
this page, RoMac stands for `The Royal Macropad`.

I also found out that the small acrylic plate that came with the macropad is supposed to be on top of the components and
micro controller, that's why it's missing in my pictures. Fixed now, but didn't bother to take new pictures.

## Get your own

The RoMac is another board that I have that is sold out most of the places, but luckily it's also open-source. So you
can order yourself one, visit
[github/TheRoyalSweatshirt](https://github.com/TheRoyalSweatshirt/The_Royal_Projects/tree/master/Complete%20Kits/The_RoMac_rev2.1)
. There is also an extremely detailed [build guide](https://imgur.com/a/l24vgvC) (maybe to detailed?).
