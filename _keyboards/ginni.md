The keyboard that got me hooked to this hobby. It's a 10 button split board, meaning that there is one button for each
finger. Using the [ASETNIOP](http://asetniop.com/) layout, you're able to type every letter. I haven't really put the
effort in to learn it myself, but I made [FreshKeebInLA](https://github.com/Kyrremann/FreshKeebInLA) as a typing game
to at least try to learn.

I mainly bought this for the aesthetic, but it turned out to be a fun soldering project. This in turn introduced me to
[Bitraf](https://bitraf.no/) and hand soldering of what I then though were really small components.

## Get your own

Ginny is made by Jane Bernhardt aka [Germ](https://twitter.com/gHeavyIndustry) aka
[g Heavy Industries](https://www.gboards.ca/). You can buy the Ginny as a kit, partial, or ready made! A kit means that
everything needs to be soldered by you, not that hard, but there are some small components. Partial is when the
components are soldered, and you just need to add some switches and keycaps. Lastly you have ready made, where everyhing is
done for you (the easiest choice).

He has also made a [Ginny Heavy](https://www.gboards.ca/product/ginny-heavy), weighing 1KG, made of industrial steel! Pretty cool!
