The keyboard that got me hooked to this hobby. It's a 10 button split board, meaning that there is one button for each
finger. Using the [ASETNIOP](http://asetniop.com/) layout, your able to type every letter. I haven't really but the
effort in to learn it my self, but I made [FreshKeebInLA](https://github.com/Kyrremann/FreshKeebInLA) as a typing game
to at least try to learn.

Mainly bought for the aesthetic, but turned out to be a fun soldering project. This in turn introduced me to
[Bitraf](https://bitraf.no/) and hand soldering of what I then though of really small components.
