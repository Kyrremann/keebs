When I got into the hobby of mechanical keyboards, I quickly found out that I wanted to create my own keyboards too. At
first I was very unsure on how to tackle that, but figured it would be good to start sourcing all the parts my
self. Meaning that I needed to order the PCB, and all the components my self. UT47.2 was one of three boards that first
time. Chosen mostly because my girlfriend wanted to try it out. Turns out its my second most used board (after the 
[Ergodash Mini]({{ site.baseurl }}/ergodash-mini) I use at work). I really like the 40% layout, and see no need for a
seperate number row.

This is also one of the few boards I want a cooler looking case, maybe somethin in wood. For now I'm using acrylic
sandwich case, which is the default case for all my boards. There is even a really cool one that looks like a
[blade](https://imgur.com/a/9jXzjGc), sadly sold out.

The UT47.2 was also the board that showed me how nice it is to have hot-swappable switch mounts, as you can easily
experiment without needed to desolder all the switches.

Two things I do miss in the UT47.2 is better room for the Norwegian letters `æøå`, and a "normal" set of arrow-keys.

## Get your own

Not sure if it's still possibly to buy it anymore, but it's open-sourced! So you can do like me and order one your self,
and source all the components. Head over to [github/ai03-2725](https://github.com/ai03-2725/UT47.2) to get your hands on
all the files you need. Just remember that the Atmega-chip in the BOM is wrong, it says you need `ATMEGA32U2-AU`, but
you need the smaller `ATMEGA32U2-MU` instead.

It is a quite difficult built, as the Atmega-chip is really small, only 5mmX5mm, and QNF! Meaning that there is no pins
to solder, as it's supposed to be soldered with paste in an oven. All the other parts are luckily easier to do by hand.
