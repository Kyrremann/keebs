This one was picked up while I visited Tokyo and [Yusha Kobo](https://yushakobo.jp/) in 2019. At that time I wasn't sure
I would be this invested in the hobby, and thought it would be a fun little projected. The day after I bought the
Meishi2 I ended up going back and buy my self an Ergodash Mini.

It's not a much used board for me, as I don't really see the need for a macropad, but I do like the look of them. Hence
why there will be more macropads on this site.

For now it let me easily take a screen shot and turn on/off [HazeOver](https://hazeover.com/). The other two buttons are
just there for show.
